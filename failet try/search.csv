or at least a spread sheet with this information.
It should list each required voting opportunity and how each mp voted and a date. ","it would enable the public to make an informed decision who to vote for, because people would be able to easily see what each MP/ party actually believes and stands for and if they have high integrity and can they be trusted to fairly represent the majority view of their constituents.
I know that I could attend a meeting to get to know an MP, but that is an old world method of information dissemination, in this new world of information technology a public website devoted to providing this info/tool could dramatically increase voter turn out, and lead to a fairer more democratic result. 
After all MPs are elected to represent, so they should provide detailed info on how they are representing, so that constituents can  ""hire or fire"" those MP's for not meeting their KPI's in the next election","presently I personally have a lot of trouble deciding who to vote for or which party to vote for, because I do not know the mp and some of the actions parties make are not decisions I agree with. I expect a lot of other people share my dilemma. I am nearly at the point of abstaining from voting due to lack of trust. 
So providing this data to the public (updated daily) would allow the public to begin to know and trust (build confidence in) the MP's and their Parties based on being able to see how they vote and how that is aligned with individual voters views. It would be much like the system Trade me use where you get to leave feedback on each others accounts which enables trade me members to know whether the trader has good or poor trading integrity.","Agency responded","116","192"

Normally there would be a net gain of around 50,000.

So this loss is troubling. I have calculated net loss against a predicted (normal) gain is around 5.7%.

I think most of these deaths are related to the so called vaccines. We have been expecting based on our research and what is actually happening in the rest of the world is mass deaths relating to the experimental mRNA ""vaccines"", via ADE or VAIDS. ADE is Antibody Dependent Enhancement, which was a hidden risk from the Pfizer trials (ie no one was told of the 8,800 reported adverse side effects), as documented in the Pfizer Document Dump. Also this monitoring data shows that 5.7% of the trial participants died. Now I do not believe in co-incidences, but this excess deaths we are seeing is also 5.7%.

The key things we need are:

* break down by land vs capital value <- this is the most essential, we need to know whether the main problem is land prices or construction costs

* time series <- we need to know how things have been changing over time, this is critical to identifying causes and solutions

* break down by geographical location <- obviously the more fine-grained the better

* break down by property class <- separate out residential from rural, commercial, industrial and apartments from detached dwellings... again, whatever classification you have is fine, some data is better than no data
","It is clearly infeasible to request data from 67 different local councils. It is impossible to get consistent and full national coverage through this approach.

It's also impossible to analyse the housing price problem through the one publicly available statistic, the national house price.

The national house price doesn't account for the different between land value and improved value.

It doesn't account for local variation (e.g. price variation between big cities and regional centres, urban cores and suburbs, rural areas close to metropolitan areas and remote rural areas).

It doesn't tell us what's happening to apartment prices.

It doesn't tell us anything about the prices of land in office buildings, industrial property or agriculture land. This last point might not be directly related to the housing crisis but it might still yield insights - who knows? We don't know what we can learn from the data unless you release it. And the price of non-residential properties does have a bearing on the effect of various proposed tax policy solutions to the housing crisis.
","For maybe a decade now, property prices have been the most important political issue in New Zealand but there are few publicly available sources of statistical information other than ""the average house price"" which is a severely limited metric. It only includes residential properties, only tracks capital value and doesn't show regional differences.

It's extremely difficult for the media, public and expert groups to assess the value of various proposed policy solutions without high-quality data.

Moreover, this information is clearly available. The land and capital value of every property in the country is assessed on a regular basis for rating purposes. This is the most important crisis affecting our country pre- and post-COVID.

Statistical data on property prices is clearly of huge public interest and any claims of commercial sensitivity are transparently illegitimate. Similar requests seem to have been met by bureaucratic buck-passing and general dodging tactics. The data exists. You have it. It is of an extremely high degree of public importance.

"Global Leadership Award Details","2023-09-02 14:09:41","2023-11-14 12:13:57","Far North District Council","On 25th July 2023, the Northland Age published an article on its front page entitled ""Far North Mayor wins Global Leadership Award"". The article explains that the mayor will accept the award and travel to Belfast in October this year to collect his award. It also explains that he earned the award for his stance in supporting the ""Make it 16"" campaign, which is for the reduction of the local body government voting age to 16, for being the first to submit a council report in the Maori language and the first elected member to have spoken only te reo Maori in a council meeting. Winners of the award were chosen by a panel of ""judges with unparalleled political expertise"" but the article does not identify those judges or disclose what organisation they belong to. It also fails to advise whether or not the mayor's expenses for that trip to Belfast are to be paid for by that organisation or by the FNDC. 

I request to be advised who the judges are and their organisation and whether or not the FNDC will be funding the expenses for the mayor's trip to Belfast. Furthermore, will the mayor be claiming annual leave for his trip to Belfast or is it deemed to be time spent on full pay?

When the mayor submitted a council report in the Maori language I request to be advised whether or not it was accompanied with an English translation. Similarly, when the mayor spoke only in te reo Maori at a council meeting, were his words translated for the accurate understanding of the attending Councillors and of the public gallery at that meeting?
 
","Making the identity of those who awarded the mayor public, establishing whether or not the expenditure of FNDC resources in this matter are appropriate and to encourage efficient communication of FNDC business when using a language that some Councillors and some of the public in the gallery may not understand. ","The secrecy around the identities of the judges and their organisation is unacceptable. That secrecy begs the question of potential fraud. Travel expenses for the award ceremony should not be funded from any FNDC account. Opening the data would establish the identity of the judges and their organisation and whether or not the FNDC is expected to fund the trip.

An award for matters that are outside the normal business of operating the FNDC, such as supporting a political campaign, should not be carried out during the mayor's normal working hours. The period of time spent travelling to that award should be booked by the mayor out of his own time, for example by drawing against his annual leave or as leave without pay.

Carrying out FNDC business in te reo Maori is not a problem provided that all who receive the report mentioned above or attended the meeting carried out in te reo fully understood what had been communicated without having to spend extra time on translation. All who receive the minutes of that meeting also need to understand them. Opening the data would establish whether or not this proviso was complied with.","Agency notified","10","953"

"Higher Quality Fire Location Data Feed","2014-10-29 11:24:24","2018-12-17 11:11:39","New Zealand Fire Service","We currently distribute free real-time fire location alerts to 1000+ New Zealanders using the NZ Fire Service's ICAD data feed, however there are a number of limitations with how this data feed is presented, which has made it difficult to develop and maintain this free service for the public.

In our opinion further investment by NZ Fire to ""open up"" ICAD fire location data and improve its quality, will result in significant public benefit.
 
Real-time NZ fire location data is extremely useful to New Zealanders. Each individual can now increase their fire risk awareness, in respect to their specific location requirements, and each individual can regulate their own behaviour and reduce their fire risk (for example farmers can receive relevant scrub fire alerts on near-by farms and change their actions).

For your reference our real-time fire alert service is described here: http://learn.thundermaps.com/fire-alerts-nz-property-owners/

For reference the NZ Fire ICAD feed our service is built on is found here: http://incidents.fire.org.nz/DefaultHome.html

How does this work? 
We have built a ""robot"" that scrapes the ICAD fire data feed and then geo-codes the location of each fire incident and then publishes alerts to subscribers via push notification to phones, or emails, or user feed updates. Because of the low quality of this ICAD data, this process is difficult and cumbersome and therefore does not provide an ideal service for users; however because we’ve already done the work, there is no doubt that the public finds real-time fire alert data useful.

People keep signing up to our free service via word-of-mouth (mostly farmers and property developers), and therefore there is little doubt that the public find this fire alert service/data useful.
 
It is our opinion that other application developers and businesses would find ICAD fire location data highly useful too, if it was provided in an easily consumable format. ThunderMaps has been able to make use of this poor quality ICAD fire data, only because we are specialists in real-time geo-data incident distribution; other developers/businesses however, are not specialists and therefore the current poor quality of the ICAD fire data-feed stops others from making use of it and the public is not as aware of fire incidents as they should be.

We request three things:

1.	That data is made available in an easy to consume and appropriate format for a real-time geo-data feed

2.	That latitude and longitude of the fire incident is included with each incident (not just the incident address)

3.	That as much 'fire description detail' is released as possible with each fire incident report (including incident updates); so that each individual can assess the incident and make an appropriate response.
 
In our opinion further investment by NZ Fire to ""open up"" ICAD fire location data and improve its quality, will result in significant public benefit.

In summary, the scopes of the database/API can be:
1. party vote data totals (incl. split party vote) and personal vote data. This will exclude voice vote data.
2. MP data including name and vote (as mentioned in 1.)
3. Legislation data including bills (1st,2nd,3rd reading, amendments, other motions). Data can include summaries, member responsible for bill, vote result (Declaration of result) and details of legislation

More detail:
The votes included in the API or Database could include bills (including amendment bills, first/second/third readings and whole house committee), other motions, amendments and the adoption of reports.

All votes can be represented by yes/no/abstain.

Party vote data could displate the party which voted for the legislation, including the members of the party.
Split party vote data could display each member of a party and how they voted.
Personal (individual/conconscience) votes can display the vote of each member.","Opening this data would solve this problem because it will increase the accessibility of the data.

However the limitations of this are that each vote is in a separate link, which totals to 11059 links currently. The problem with this is that it is not easy to search through the voting data to find specific data based on your desired criteria (i.e., title of bill, members who voted), unless you search manually through the Hansard reports. The issue with searching manually is that it restricts other forms of more efficient data collection, such as a researcher, application or website being able to track voting records.
Therefore a database or an api can centralise all the voting information, make the data more accessible to the general public and provide data for researchers and applications which can compile voting data and make it more accessible to the general public.","Information on the voting record of Members of Parliaments should be as easily accessible by the general public, since they are elected to represent their constituents.

If possible, provide a downloadable spreadsheet giving these data for the last 6 months.","Allowing full analysis of COVID-19 outcomes by age and vaccination status.","Some of this data used to be available, as a matter of course, but data on COVID-19 and vaccinations has progressively narrowed. It is now impossible to accurately assess the effectiveness of vaccines for COVID-19, based on the published data. Earlier last year, it was clear, from the data that, overall, the best defence against hospitalisation from COVID-19 was to get the primary course of vaccinations. Getting a booster, reduced the protection, overall, to the level of the unvaccinated. With the data we have now, this still appears to be the case but person view vaccination data is only available for booster doses, not for the primary course, and only hospitalisation data by vaccination status is available. There is no death data by vaccination status, except death within 28 days of testing positive, which is only a rough guide. There is no reasonable age group data for COVID-19 vaccinations, hospitalisations or deaths by vaccination status.

Consequently, the only thing we can say with publicly available data is that getting a booster is not a good move. But it is highly probable that there are age-related nuances to this conclusion but this can only be determined with better data, which I'm sure is languishing somewhere in the Ministry of Health.

This will show that there is nothing to hide concerning vaccinations and it is likely to show that boosters are important for some age groups.

"Descriptions of Government Budget Line-Items","2011-06-16 15:32:54","2020-05-21 20:43:41","The Treasury","The paragraph-length descriptions of line items in the Government Budget, as found in Estimates of Appropriations PDFs, in a structured computer-readable queryable format like a spreadsheet, XML, JSON, or semantic HTML tables.

I think the proper name of these line-item descriptions is ""Scopes of Appropriations"". For example, as seen in http://treasury.govt.nz/budget/2011/estimates/est11health.pdf, the description of ""Health Sector Information Systems"" is ""This appropriation is limited to the provision of information technology services and the publication of data derived from these services to the health and disability system.""

Ideally I'd like to have a description for each item in the budget spreadsheets available at http://treasury.govt.nz/budget/2011/data. It would be great to have these descriptions available in the budget expenses/incomes spreadsheets (that's probably the easiest way to do it, you could just add another column to the spreadsheet), or otherwise some other structured computer-readable format like XML or JSON or even semantic HTML tables.","I could change the site so you can hover over an expense and see a paragraph-length description of the item, letting users answer questions like ""what is this, really?"", and help them better understand the government budget.","I run http://wheresmytaxes.co.nz, and some of the budget items are difficult to understand.

For example, under Ministry of Health, there are line items like ""Payment Services"", ""Provider Development"", ""Sector Planning and Performance"", ""Managing the Purchases of Services"". These all sound very vague, and I don't know how to interpret them, and I get a lot of questions like ""what does this mean?"".

The data is available right now, in PDFs like http://treasury.govt.nz/budget/2011/estimates/est11health.pdf on the page http://treasury.govt.nz/budget/2011/estimates.

However, it's very difficult to extract the relevant data from these PDFs so I can incorporate it into the website. I tried writing a program to extract the data, but it proved too difficult (extracting data from PDFs is a nightmare). I could go through and copy the descriptions out by hand, but that would take a very long time (there are thousands of line items in the budget), and all my work would be obsolete when the next budget comes out next year, and I'd have to do it all over again - and so would anybody else who wants to visualise this data. So I think it would be best for Treasury to manage it once for everyone, as they already have all the data in a workable format.","Agency responded","5","25"

I hope to show that before NZ switched to proportional representation in the 1990s, election turnout was evolving in the same way for both local and general elections, and that switching systems lead to higher voter turnout in general election compared to local elections.
Given NZ commonwealth status and as an advanced democracy, I am hoping this dataset and subsequent analysis will can shine some insight on how other countries, such as my native Canada, can improve voter engagement and trust in economic and political institutions more broadly - an area that NZ performs very well on in many international rankings. ","Evaluating how effective proportional representation is at increasing voter turnout.
Because New Zealand uses First-past-the-post for most of their local elections, but proportional representation at the national level, it makes a very good candidate for studying the effects that New Zealand's switch to a proportional representation has on voter turnout, and by extent engagement in the political process by voters.","Agency responded","4","372"

- time series datasets, some with periodic (eg monthly) time scales.

Teachers and students would need to save the rectangular dataset as a csv file, so they can open it in software such as https://inzight.nz/ .
Also, they will need metadata with context and details of variables, set of data contributors,  and data sources.

"Folio Numbers for Historical Birth and Death Registrations","2023-08-11 11:19:00","2024-03-18 14:40:58","Department of Internal Affairs","Births, Deaths and Marriages Online provides public access to a large database of historical births, deaths and marriages.  This is a vital resource to historians and researchers.

However the search results do not include the Folio Number associated with each birth/death registration.

The Folio Number refers to the page number in the official register at the time the original registration was recorded.  This is useful because it can be used to look up what district the birth or death was registered in, using publicly available District Key documents.

The folio number is already publicly available information - in numerous public libraries historical BDM records are available to peruse via microfiche and these include the Folio Number.  The absence of the folio number from the online BDM search tool makes the search results significantly less useful compared to the library microfiches, but obviously these microfiches are not nearly as accessible as a website, particularly for disabled researchers.

Recent legislation explicitly supports making Folio numbers available - see the Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Relationships Registration Act 2021, Section 89 (2): 

""The Registrar-General may also make available, in respect of a birth, marriage, or death recorded in a pre-1998 register, the folio number for the information.""

Data Formats

The folio number data could be provided a number of formats, whichever is most convenient to BDMs/DIA:
- Added as a column on the BDM search results (most preferable, but may involve some website development work)
- Provided as a CSV/spreadsheet (perhaps over multiple files eg yearly) with the folio number listed beside each historical birth/death registration number.
- Provided as a database export (eg a SQL file) - least preferable

Notes

- This request obviously applies ONLY to historical birth and death registrations as per BDM's criteria, eg, births that occurred more than 100 years ago, and so on.
- The sharp-eyed reader may have noticed I have asked only for birth and death folio numbers, omitting marriage registrations. 
 That is because marriage registrations were recorded in a different fashion and their folio numbers do not provide district information.  In addition, marriage registration folio numbers are currently available online via Otago University's Varcoe's NZ Marriages Index.","Providing the folio number would allow researchers to look up what district the birth or death was registered in, using publicly available District Key documents (available at libraries and online, eg, on the NZSG website).

Providing this information online should be a straight-forward task and would be of great benefit to genealogists, historians and other researchers.","BDM's historical birth and death records currently do not include what district the birth or death was registered in, making genealogical and historical research more time-consuming than necessary.

Providing the folio number would give researchers easy access to this important and useful contextual information.

As part of my research, I would like to establish what health and safety issues the strawberry industry is dealing with. Much of the online data I have found so far is quite broad by industry and I think most strawberry issues would be reported under Agriculture? I think some strawberry related injuries may be filed under transport or warehousing in some instances. What I would ideally like to write about is injuries in the sub-category of Horticulture, the sub-category of strawberry harvesting and even a break down of what strawberry harvesting activity resulted in the most injuries e.g. twisting, bending over, squatting as well as pruning, harvesting etc. along with the types of injuries being reported.","If we can understand the negative impacts and injuries caused by strawberry harvesting, we can design a new system that see a reduction in these events. we need to know how people are being affected currently such as:
- Is there repetitive picking motion causing arm, back or leg injuries?
- Are there injuries due to use of current equipment within the industry?
- Does moving heavy strawberry weights cause pain?","The aim of the work we are conducting is to address several factors:
- Help resolve the shortage of labor mainly during fruit harvesting.
- Identify aspects of Strawberry harvesting that are causing injuries.
- Broaden the demographic of people able to conduct picking activates.
- reduce fruit loss due to harvest damage.
- Improve working conditions of pickers during harvest.","Agency notified","1","883"

","I am an academic researcher in the AUT School of Economics, trained in Econometrics and Applied Microeconomics. I am a user of the StatsNZ IDI (Integrated Data Infrastructure) and have gone through their confidentiality training. I understand that you might not want to release the disaggregated GMP data to the public due to confidentiality reasons, but I am willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement if need be so to have access to this data confidentially. ","What factors increase or decrease class 4 GMP at a particular venue? Does the number of machines matter? Does the number of venues nearby matter? Does the corporate society matter? Does the number of jackpots matter? Does the local social deprivation index matter? 

These are especially important questions given my initial finding: Class 4 GMP per capita (adjusted for inflation) in NZ has been falling steadily since the implementation of sinking lid and cap policies by local councils. But it has stopped falling since 2014 and has been steady since. Why? Disaggregated data will allow us to tell a rich, nuanced story on a very important topic with wide-ranging impact. 

Research into the factors that cause gaming machine proceeds per capita to fall, or not, will help evaluate and guide policies in the regulation of class 4 gambling. Part of the role of the regular (Department of Internal Affairs) is to minimise harm caused by gambling, which is strongly correlated with GMP.

","Electorate boundaries are required to fit within an population range based on their electoral population. For general electorates the general electoral population is used and for Māori electorates, the Māori electoral population is used. Submitters need to know these electoral populations to understand whether boundary changes are feasible, without this data the ability to make effective submissions is significantly limited.

In particular, without this data it is not feasible for a submission to do much more than tweak existing boundaries. It is possible that there are undiscovered redistricting options that would affect a group of electorates and result in a overall better balance of community of interest. Without access to the population data, members of the public cannot investigate these options and submit these sorts of proposals.

Between representation commissions this data is useful for researchers investigating a range of subjects such as changes to the number of electorates, different types of electoral system, geographic characteristics of the Māori electoral populationm variation in turnout by local area. Māori electorates tend to have a low turn-out: this data could help researchers to better understand why this is.","Agency responded","1","416"

"Areas Susceptible to Coastal Instability and Erosion (ASCIE)","2022-05-24 11:49:59","2022-06-27 12:45:57","Auckland Council","The Auckland region has a high exposure to coastal hazards including coastal instability and erosion. These hazards can present a safety risk, adversely affect property and infrastructure, and damage or destroy cultural and environmental sites. A program of research has been undertaken to identify, at a regional level, the Area Susceptible to Coastal Instability and/or Erosion (ASCIE). ASCIE is the area landward of the current coastline that is at risk because of coastal erosion or instability caused by coastal erosion. The study forecasts the areas of Auckland’s coastline that could be affected by coastal erosion and instability under a range of climate change (sea-level rise) scenarios and timeframes.


This data is mapped at a 0.5 km to 5.0 km scale and is not intended for site-specific use other than to determine whether more detailed study is warranted. Due to the large scale of the assessment (i.e., 0.5-5 km resolution) errors are inherently introduced due to the variance within a coastal cell. To identify areas that could potentially be susceptible to coastal instability and/or erosion typical upper bound values have been adopted for each coastal cell. This means that in some areas the ASCIE may be overpredicted (i.e., shown further landward). However, this also means that in ASCIE may be underpredicted in areas where values are larger than the typical upper bound value (i.e., the largest or maximum values). Therefore, this assessment is recommended to be used as a preliminary tool. The regional-scale ASCIE can be refined by undertaking an assessment on a more detailed scale.
The purpose of the ASCIE identified within this ‘first-pass’ assessment is that they represent land potentially susceptible to coastal erosion and/or land instability associated with this erosion at a regional scale for present day conditions and a range of possible future climate change states. This means the areas outside of the identified ASCIE may be considered unlikely to be susceptible. It should be noted that this ‘first-pass’ assessment has been undertaken at a high level (regional scale) and may be superseded by local (Level B) and site-specific (Level C) scale assessment by a suitably qualified and experienced practitioner.

This ASCIE mapping should not be used for the assessment of the erosion susceptibility of individual properties. As a ‘first-pass’ assessment it may include significant inaccuracies at localised levels. Assessment of individual properties (e.g. for consenting, valuation and insurance purposes) should be based on a site-specific (Level C) geotechnical assessment prepared by a suitably qualified and experienced practitioner.

Notes: According to mental health experts, many pathological and compulsive liars do believe the stories they’re telling. They may have repeated their lies so often that they start to feel true. Pathological liars often live in a fantasy world they’ve constructed, in which their “truth” becomes reality.

- Does moving heavy strawberry weights cause pain?
","The aim of the work we are conducting is to address several factors:
- Help resolve the shortage of labor mainly during fruit harvesting.
- Identify aspects of Strawberry harvesting that are causing injuries.
- Broaden the demographic of people able to conduct picking activates.
- reduce fruit loss due to harvest damage.

The dataset we require pertains to Bioclimatic Zones and can be found at this link: Bioclimatic Zones Dataset. It's worth noting that the current dataset is confined to the Waikato region, whereas our project necessitates comprehensive coverage of the entire New Zealand.
Our project entails the development of a Visual Web Application, which will seamlessly integrate this dataset with historical carbon emission data spanning several years. At its current stage, our endeavor stands as a prototype. The forthcoming application, christened ""EcoTrendNZ,"" aims to holistically represent and analyze ecological trends and their intersections with carbon emissions.","EcoTrendNZ is a comprehensive analytics tool designed to visualize and analyse different bio-climatic zones across New Zealand. The project aims to provide valuable insights into various sectors, including environmental conservation, urban planning,agriculture, and climate change mitigation. By integrating bio-climatic zone data with carbon emission levels, EcoTrendNZ offers a holistic perspective on environmental patterns,empowering data-driven decision-making and sustainable practices. Consequently, the tool
will be instrumental to accomplish sustainable practices and contribute economic growth of the country.","Unlocking access to this broader dataset would address a critical limitation in our current project. Specifically, the dataset available for Bioclimatic Zones is currently confined to the Waikato region, allowing us to highlight data only for the following zones:

    Coastal Zone
    Lowland Zone
    Submontane Zone
    Montane Zone
    Subalpine Zone
    Alpine Zone

However, our project's ambitions extend beyond this regional scope. By obtaining a more comprehensive dataset encompassing the entire New Zealand, we can significantly enhance the accuracy and scope of our project.

Expanding our dataset would enable us to create a more holistic representation of ecological patterns and trends throughout the entire country. This, in turn, would allow us to offer a more complete and accurate analysis of the relationship between bioclimatic zones and carbon emissions, transcending the geographical boundaries of the Waikato region. The resulting insights would not only contribute to a more robust prototype of our EcoTrendNZ application but also provide valuable information for broader ecological research and policymaking in New Zealand.

- Does carrying the picking bag cause back pain? ","The aim of the work we are conducting is to address several factors:

This data set would contain images that are held by the government that are either in the public domain or are licensed under either the Creative Commons Attribution or Attribution/Share Alike licence and a binomial species name accompanying each image.

As Wikimedia Commons is free, popular and easy to use, once the images are loaded into it would allow easy access to other people and groups such as schools, universities, conservation groups etc the world over to make use of these images in their work and would help to publicise and educate people about New Zealand biodiversity and the need to protect it.

I hope you’re keeping well and safe!

My name is Nalin Arachchilage, and I currently work as a Lecturer in Cyber Security at the University of Auckland (UoA), New Zealand. I am currently working with a group of researchers from the Faculty of Health at UoA on an illicit tobacco research project. 

I wondered if we could access the dataset related to illicit tobacco in NZ (or illicit tobacco in general). 

I was wondering if there is a better tool we can use to get dataset in NZ for our research purposes, other than scraping data using Python script from scratch. 

Area of focus: This research focuses on investigating the size and scope of illicit trafficking of tobacco in New Zealand and the diverse types of tobacco-related products available on the crypto markets. Furthermore, we examine how tobacco products are distributed within New Zealand from a global network through illicit online platform economies known as cryptomarkets.  


Many thanks.

Cheers,
Nalin
